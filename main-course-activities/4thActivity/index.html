            >, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max do not include a power

            We encourage you to re‑use your current USB‑A to Lightning cables,
            power adapters, and headphones, which are compatible with these
            iPhone models. But if you need any new Apple power adapters or
            headphones, they are available for purchase.

              Why should I buy a SIM-free iPhone on apple.com?
            </summary>
            <p>
              An unconnected iPhone purchased from apple.com is unlocked. This
              means you aren’t tied to a single network provider or a multiyear
              service contract. You can choose the network and tariff that are
              right for you. Once your new iPhone is activated, it remains
              unlocked, which means you can use it with any network that
              provides service for iPhone.

              Yes. An unconnected iPhone purchased from apple.com is unlocked.

              Which network providers offer 5G service?

              iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are 5G capable. For 5G access, you
              need to activate your iPhone with a network provider that offers
              5G service. Some providers may also require a 5G service plan or a
              new SIM. Contact your provider for more information. Learn more
